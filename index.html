    <h2>Domestic Travel Throughout the Year</h2>
    <p>
      The figure below shows the distribution of domestic travel throughout the year for both states and airports.
      From the map we see a relatively stable number of travellers throughout the year, with the majority both departing from and landing in airports
      on the east coast.

          <h2>Flights vs Passenger Numbers</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the steady number of travellers shown on the map above, when graphing the percent change in the number of flights and passengers throughout the year we see a much higher variance in the number of flights. For example, while the number of travellers in April is only 1% less than January, the number of flights drops by a massive 49%.
          </p>
          <p>
             This may mean that the number of travellers in a given month is not necessarily a good indicator of whether there are a sufficient number of flights for everyone.

    <h2>Flight Performance Throughout the Year</h2>
    <p>
      The charts below show the number of flights per month, categorised as an on time flight, a delayed arrival, and a delayed departure. 
    </p>
      <p>
      From the left graph we can see despite the total number of flights changing drastically throughout the year, the number of delays remains relatively constant, while the number of on time flights fluctuates greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is further displayed by the right chart which shows only the proportion of flights in each category. During the middle of the year the number of delayed flights increases, coinciding with the large reduction in the number of flights shown previously.
    </p>
    <div id="MonthlyFlights" class="vis-container"></div>

    <h2>
      Are Insufficient Flights Worsening Performance?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Overall, while the similar shape the number of flights and number of delays take on is interesting, this does not necessarily mean an insufficient number of flights is the reason for the worsened performance in the middle of the year. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Many other factors not considered here such as weather conditions or international travel likely influence the performance of airlines throughout the year, and the correlation between the number of flights and performance does not necessarily imply causation.
